- The calculations are loosing precision when the image is being scaled down because
    they are done as integers. ~object centers become off by a factor of the down scale -- 25% image causes the center to be off by ~2 pixels
- Auto-Detect screen and browser settings
- Allow settings to be changed for different AI implementations. Probably split these into a class implementing an abstract AI class.

- Upgrade UI to JavaFx
- Updated the display to show where the current decided movement is.
- Create configurations for changing settings in UI

(2-4-17)
- Allow for analyze image to calculate for the config scale
    *Takes into account given image size, not the scale number progamatically stored.
- Separate imaging and decision processing to separate threads
    *Split into Producer/Consumer Model using two threads.

(1-22-17)
- Use a real image processor for scaling images better
    *Image processor stayed the same -- instead the de-colorizing method
     was greatly improved. Estimating an object's center is now far
     more accurate. Object size is now based on an estimation of the area.
     Finding the player has been revised.
