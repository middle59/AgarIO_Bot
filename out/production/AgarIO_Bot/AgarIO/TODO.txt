- Allow for analyze image to calculate for the config scale
    -The calculations are loosing precision when the image is being scaled down because
    they are done as integers. ~object centers become off by a factor of the down scale -- 25% image causes the center to be off by ~2 pixels
- Separate imaging and decision processing to separate threads
- Create configurations for changing settings in UI
- Auto-Detect screen and browser settings

- Use a real image processor for scaling images better
    *Image processor stayed the same -- instead the de-colorizing method
     was greatly improved. Estimating an object's center is now far
     more accurate. Object size is now based on an estimation of the area.
     Finding the player has been revised.
